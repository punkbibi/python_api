# python_api ptoject
This is the project for university, where I was ought to write a code using apis. so I decided to use api where are jokes about chuck norris and currency exchange rate.
First of all i made a small function to get joke from server and made it pop up on windows notification bar. 
Second api is easily coded. It exhanges different currencies in each other. everything is the same, all of the attributes of both api's are saved and written in seperate json files.
After everything I created a database table and imported all the important infos in it.
